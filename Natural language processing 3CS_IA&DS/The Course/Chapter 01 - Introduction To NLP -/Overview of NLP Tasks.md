## Text Classification
The process of assigning predefined categories or labels to a given text based on its content. This can include tasks like **sentiment analysis**, **spam detection**, topic categorization, and more.
## Information Extraction
Automatically extracting structured information from unstructured text. This includes identifying entities (like names, dates, locations), relationships between entities, and specific facts like **Name Entity Recognition** and **Part-of-Speech Tagging**.
## Information Retrieval
The process of finding relevant documents or pieces of information from a large repository in response to a user query. It’s the backbone of search engines.
## Language Modeling
The task of predicting the next word or sequence of words in a sentence, given the preceding words. It’s fundamental to many NLP tasks, including **text generation** and **speech recognition**.
## Text Summarization
The process of automatically generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document. It can be **extractive** (selecting key sentences) or **abstractive** (generating new sentences).
## Machine Translation
 The automatic conversion of text from one language to another. It involves understanding the meaning of the source text and generating an equivalent text in the target language.
## Dialogue Systems
Also known as conversational agents or chatbots, are systems designed to engage in a conversation with a human user. They can be task-oriented (focused on specific tasks) or open-domain (general conversation).
## Autocorrect
 Feature that automatically corrects spelling and typographical errors in text input. It typically uses a combination of dictionaries, language models, and context to suggest corrections.
## Text Similarity and Semantic Similarity
Text similarity measures how similar two pieces of text are, often based on surface-level features like word overlap. Semantic similarity, on the other hand, measures how similar the meanings of two texts are, even if they use different words.
## Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
The process of converting images of text (such as scanned documents or photos of text) into machine-readable text. It involves recognizing characters and words from the image.
## Speech Recognition
The process of converting spoken language into text. It involves recognizing and transcribing the words spoken by a user.
