# What Is Natural Language Processing?
👉🏻 Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to communicating method with an intelligent system using a natural language such as English, Spanish or Arabic.
👉🏻 Also known as **Computational Linguistic (CL), Human Language Technology (HLT), Natural Language Engineering (NLE). 
👉🏻 It's the interaction between <u>Computer science</u>, <u>Artificial intelligence</u> and <u>Human  language </u>. 
👉🏻 Sums up **all** methods covering the pure processing of language by means of algorithmic, statistic, heuristic etc.

👉🏻 The goal of NLP is to allow a intelligent machine to obtain useful information from computing system or give commands to the computing system using NLP by speaking or writing.
# Why Use Natural Language Processing?
👉🏻 Help Computers communicate with humans in their own language.
👉🏻 Text is the largest repository of human knowledge 
👉🏻 Helps resolve ambiguity in language and adds useful numeric structure to the data for many downstream applications, such as speech recognitions or text analytics.
👉🏻 Identify the mood or subjective opinion within large amounts of text, including average sentiment and opinion meaning (**Sentiment  Analysis**)
👉🏻 Transforming voice commands into written text, and vice versa (**Speech-to-text & text-to-speech conversation**)
👉🏻 Automatically generate synopses of large bodies of text (**Document summarization**)

# Where NLP Was Used?
👉🏻 Email filters
👉🏻 Smart assistants
👉🏻 Search results
👉🏻 Predictive text
👉🏻 Language translation
👉🏻 Data analysis

# Why NLP Is Difficult?
#### 👉🏻 Language is ambiguous

#### 👉🏻 Language is flexible
New words, different meanings in different context.
#### 👉🏻 Problem of sparsity
very difficult due to statistical analysis, most (words, concept) are never seen before.
#### 👉🏻 Complex Language
