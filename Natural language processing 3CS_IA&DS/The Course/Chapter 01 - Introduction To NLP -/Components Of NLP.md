## Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
👉🏻 Helps the machine to understand and analyze human language by extracting the **metadata** from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, emotions, relations and semantic role.
👉🏻 The process of reading and interpreting the language. 
👉🏻 It produces non-linguistic output from natural language input

### Lexical ambiguity
Words have multiple meanings exp:
1. Bank:
    - "I went to the bank to deposit my paycheck." (Here, "bank" refers to a financial institution.)
    - "The bank of the river was lined with trees." (Here, "bank" refers to the side of a river.)
2. Head:
    - "I have a headache." (Here, "head" refers to the upper part of the human body.)
    - "The head of the company will be speaking at the conference." (Here, "head" refers to a person in a position of authority.)
### Syntactical ambiguity 
Sentences having multiple parse trees, exp : 
1. "I went to the store with my friend and bought a shirt."
    - This sentence can be interpreted in two ways:
        - I went to the store with my friend, and I bought a shirt.
        - I went to the store with my friend, and we bought a shirt together.
### Referential ambiguity 
Occurs when a word or phrase in a sentence can refer to more than one thing. exp:
1. "The student was given a low grade by the teacher because he was late."
    - This sentence can be interpreted in two ways:
        - The student was given a low grade by the teacher because the student was late.
        - The student was given a low grade by the teacher because the teacher was late.

2. John told his father that he was going to the park."
	- In this sentence, the pronoun "he" is referentially ambiguous because it's unclear whether it refers to John or to John's father.
## Natural Language Generation (NLG)
👉🏻 Acts as translator that converts the computerized data into natural language presentation.
👉🏻 The process of writing or generating the language.
👉🏻 It produces contracting natural language from non-linguistic input.
### Text Planning
- This is the process of organizing and structuring the content of a text.
- It involves deciding on the overall purpose, main ideas, and logical flow of the text.
- It helps ensure the coherence and cohesion of the final text.
### Sentence Planning
- This is the process of determining the specific structure and wording of individual sentences.
- It involves selecting appropriate vocabulary, grammatical structures, and rhetorical devices to convey the intended meaning.
- It helps ensure the clarity, conciseness, and expressiveness of the sentences.
### Text Realization 
- This is the final stage of the text generation process, where the planned content and sentence structures are transformed into the actual written text.
- It involves the physical act of writing or typing the text, as well as the application of formatting, punctuation, and other typographical conventions.
- It helps ensure the final text is visually appealing and easy to read.
